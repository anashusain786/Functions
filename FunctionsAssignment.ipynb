        "   - In Python, a **function** is a block of code that performs a task and can be called on its own using its name. It's not tied to any object. A **method**, on the other hand, is like a function but it's associated with an object and is called using that object. For example, len() is a function, but \"hello\".upper() is a method. Methods usually act on the data inside the object they belong to, while functions can work with any data passed to them.\n"

For example, in def greet(name):, name is a parameter. If you call greet(\"Anas\"), then \"Anas\" is the argument. Parameters act like placeholders, and arguments fill those placeholders when the function runs. This allows functions to work with different inputs without rewriting the code.\n"

When a function reaches return, it stops running and gives back the specified value. This allows you to store or use the output elsewhere in your code. Without return, a function just performs actions but doesn't give anything back. It's useful when you want the function to calculate something and hand over the result.\n"

An **iterator** is the object that actually keeps track of where you are in the loop and gives the next value when you call next() on it. The key difference is that iterables can be turned into iterators, but iterators can only go forward and remember their current position.\n"

        "   - Generators in Python are a special type of function that let you create an iterator in a simpler way. Instead of returning all the values at once, they give one value at a time using the `yield` keyword. Each time you call `next()` on a generator, it continues from where it left off, saving memory in the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - To define a generator, you use the `def` keyword like a normal function, but include `yield` instead of `return`. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def count_up_to(n):\n",
        "    i = 1\n",
        "    while i <= n:\n",

        "        i += 1\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Calling `count_up_to(5)` won’t run the whole function instantly. It gives a generator object that you can loop through or call `next()` on to get each number one by one.\n"

        "   - Generators are useful when you want to handle large amounts of data without using too much memory. Unlike regular functions that compute and return all values at once, generators give one value at a time using `yield`, which makes them more memory-efficient. They only produce the next value when needed, which is great for working with big files, streams, or long sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Another benefit is that they keep track of their state between each call, so you don’t need to write extra code to remember where you left off. Generators also make your code cleaner and simpler when you're dealing with loops that could otherwise get complicated. Overall, they help improve performance and make your programs faster and lighter.\n"

        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used ?\n",
        "   - A lambda function in Python is a short, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword instead of def. It can have any number of inputs but only one expression. For example, lambda x: x * 2 creates a function that doubles the input. It's mostly used when you need a quick function for a short period, like inside map(), filter(), or sorted().\n",
        "\n",
        "   - These functions are helpful when you don’t want to write a full function using def, especially for simple tasks. Since they return the result of the expression automatically, you don't need to use the return keyword. Lambda functions are often used when passing logic as an argument in one-liners or quick operations.\n"

        "   - The map() function in Python is used to apply a function to every item in an iterable, like a list or tuple, without writing a loop. It takes two arguments: the function to apply and the iterable to process. For example, map(str.upper, ['a', 'b', 'c']) will return an object that contains 'A', 'B', and 'C'.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - It doesn't change the original data but gives you a new mapped result. Since map() returns a special object, you usually convert it to a list using list() to see the output. It's useful when you want to perform the same operation on each item, like converting numbers, formatting strings, or applying calculations. It helps keep your code shorter and more readable.\n"

        "    - map() is used to apply a function to each item in an iterable and returns a new iterable with the results.\n",
